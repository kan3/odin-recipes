    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p class="desc">Waffles are a classic breakfast and brunch staple that have become so popular because of their amazing crispy golden exterior with deep pockets for holding syrup and butter! My family would have these waffles every single weekend, and in fact, sometimes I get up early on a weekday morning because I'm craving them! Everyone knows and loves getting waffles at their favorite breakfast restaurants, and they're truly just as easy to make at home!  Want more waffles all the time like we do?  Try out these Blueberry Waffles they're so easy!!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>Maple syrup and butter, as desired, for serving </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li class="desc">Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li class="desc">In a small bowl, whisk milk and eggs; pour over flour mixture, and whisk gently to combine (don't overmix). Gently whisk in butter.</li>
        <li class="desc">Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffles until deep brown and crisp. (For a standard waffle iron, pour a generous 1/2 cup of batter into center, spreading to within 1/2 inch of edges, and close; waffle will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.) Serve warm, with maple syrup and butter, as desired.</li>
    </ol>
