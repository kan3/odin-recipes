    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p class="desc">Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li> 
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li class="desc">Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li class="desc">Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li class="desc">Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
